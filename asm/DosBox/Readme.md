# first.asm #
This is a simple hello world which I tinkered with a bit

# second.asm #

# DosBox #
using dosbox (or Boxerapp on mac) you can run simpler assembly programs than you can when you are in the infrastructure of the advanced 2019 operating system apis.  You are much closer to the bare metal.

Also you can count on consistent addresses and file sizes.

#  Boot Sector Games #
I bought a book called programming boot sector games and it tutors you through making assembly programs and compiling them with nasm and running them with dosbox.

# Nasm #
Usually so far the nasm command has been
`nasm -f bin first.asm -o first.com`
